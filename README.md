webpack angular@1 weird build

# Angular@1
[angular](https://code.angularjs.org/1.5.8/docs/guide/introduction) 1.5.8 is not good choice to build via webpack cause ES6 common module type can not used. Angular module and ES6 module type is different and can not use in same time. Now angular module is available.

# How to use it
Development: `npm install && npm start`

Test: `npm test`
